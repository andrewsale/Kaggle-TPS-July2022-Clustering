# Kaggle-TPS-July2022-Clustering
My solution for the Kaggle Tabular Playground of July 2022 that involved training a clustering model.

Kaggle's description:

> Welcome to Kaggle's first ever unsupervised clustering challenge!
> 
> In this challenge, you are given a dataset where each row belongs to a particular cluster. Your job is to predict the cluster each row belongs to. You are not given any training data, and you are not told how many clusters are found in the ground truth labels.
